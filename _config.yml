                      <h3>Yeonwoo Lee</h3><br>Game Researcher<br>•<br>Game Curator<br>•<br>UX Designer<br> 
introduction        : Yeonwoo Lee is a Game Researcher, Game Curator, and UX Designer. She holds a BA in Philosophy from Duksung Women’s University, South Korea and an MA in Media Cultural Studies from Yonsei University, South Korea. Her master’s thesis explored gamer consumer activism, reflecting her deep interest in the relationships between people, games, and digital objects. Her current research focuses on how games shape human relationships and what games mean in the context of contemporary society—how we play, and why it matters. <br><br>Yeonwoo previously contributed to the Netmarble Game Museum project and participated in several player-centered research initiatives at the Game-n-Science Institution (TGSI). She is also a member of the editorial board of Game Generation (GG), a Korean webzine dedicated to digital games and gaming culture. Currently, she is working as a research assistant for the ERC ORE Project, where she continues to explore the cultural and social dimensions of games.
